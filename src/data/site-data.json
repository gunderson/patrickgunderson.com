The goal for AdBlitz 2013 was to create a one-stop destination during-and-after-the-game for users alike to watch, vote and share their favorite ads.</p><p>YouTube created a completely new brand identity for its biggest sponsorship program. Filled with social commentary, fun facts, interactive widgets and of course, the Super Bowl ads themselves! The team also produced a second-screen experience specifically for mobile users during the game, an online promotional video about the campaign to signal when voting started.</p>",
